-one transaction is broadcasted to 90% of the node in around 15 seconds (2017/04/05)
Then it depends on how you send:If it sends 1, waits for it to propagate, then sends the next, yes
If it just sends them all together, then it's more important to consider how many bytes total are being sent than how many transactions are

10 000 thousands transactions at the same time --> memory problem(too many thread)
